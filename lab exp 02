# Ex. No. 2: Recover Deleted or Damaged Files Using TestDisk  

## AIM  
Step-by-step process to recover a missing partition and repair a corrupted one using **TestDisk**.

## 1. Log Creation  
- TestDisk detects and lists all hard drives with their correct sizes.  
- Use **arrow keys** to select the hard drive with the lost partition.  
- For faster transfer, prefer `/dev/rdisk*` over `/dev/disk*` (if available).

## 2. Partition Table Type Selection  
- TestDisk auto-detects the partition table type.  
- The default value is usually correct.  
- Press **Enter** to proceed.

## 3. Analyse Partition Structure
